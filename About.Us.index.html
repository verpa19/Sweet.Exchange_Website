                        Welcome to my page The Sweet Exchange! This website was build for people to order any type of cupcakes
                        ranging from different sizes and flavours. We do both Home delivery and pick up delivery from my home.
                        Some flavours are displayed on my Home page, any other choices of flavours can be sent to me on the 
                        Contact Us page. Looking forward to receiving any orders that you have from you customers! We do offer
                        cupcakes for any intolerance. All our ingredients are freshly bought and our cupcakes are done homemade
                        by myself usually done a night before or on the day itself in order to give you the best freshly baked
                        and tastful cupcakes you ever had!
